2- Implement a function called sort students that takes a list of student objects as input and sorts the list based on their CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) in descending order. Each student object has the following attributes: name (string), roll_number (string), and cgpa (float). Test the function with different input lists of students.










class Student:

  def __init__(self, name, roll_number, cgpa):
    self.name = name
    self.roll_number = roll_number
    self.cgpa = cgpa


def sort_students(student_list):
  # Sort the student list based on CGPA in descending order
  sorted_students = sorted(student_list,
                           key=lambda student: student.cgpa,
                           reverse=True)
  return sorted_students


# Test the function with a list of students
student1 = Student("Alice", "A101", 3.8)
student2 = Student("Bob", "B202", 3.5)
student3 = Student("Charlie", "C303", 3.7)

students = [student1, student2, student3]

sorted_students = sort_students(students)

for student in sorted_students:
  print(
      f"Name: {student.name}, Roll Number: {student.roll_number}, CGPA: {student.cgpa}"
  )
